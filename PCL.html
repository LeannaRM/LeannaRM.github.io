      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h5>I'm a Web Developer</h5>
      <p>
        As a dynamic and adaptable developer, I have a passion for learning. I am excited by complex problems that require detailed analysis and synthesis of large quantities of data. Through my years doing scientific research, I have developed a persistence and determination to be a part of projects from conception to completion and implementation.
      </p>
      <h5>Things I Love</h5>
      <p>
        I can often be found out for a run, trying out a new recipe, or reading about the most recent workout trend. I also love to travel, but have been known to spend hours doing puzzles or playing scrabble throughout a vacation. I am often torn between my beloved Huskers and Fighting Irish and will participate in any event that involves encouraging girls and women to enter a STEM field.
      </p>
      <h5>What I Do</h5>
      <p>
        I have a background in biophysics and biochemistry where I utilized programming (Matlab!) to analyze data about protein structure. After 8 years of scientific research, I realized I did not have a passion for the science, but had a passion for the coding, problem solving and unlimited learning. I want to be challenged every day by hard problems that make me learn more and get better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value a team that encourages one another to grow and succeed, supports collaboration, and understands the need to communicate clearly and effectively.

      <h3>About You</h3>
      <h5>You Are The Best</h5>
      <p>
        You are Hudl. You are <em>THE</em> name in sports technology. 
      </p>
      <h5>You Need The Best</h5>
      <p>
        
        You need a rock star. You need somebody that will tell you “no”, that will fight for an idea, and that isn’t such a fanboy that he won’t challenge years of what 37signals has established as the way to do the web.
        I’ll be honest. There are tons of reasons not to try for this job. Sure, on the surface it sounds like a dream to work for 37signals. Your philosophy makes me say “right on” and the way you have described your work environment makes it sound exactly like the kind of place a creative person could soar. This is a high-profile job at a company that is put on a pedestal by the web community. Who wouldn’t covet such an amazing opportunity? I certainly do, but it’s not all fun and games — this is a tough challenge. Redesigning your marketing websites and eventually the products, themselves, will invite an incredible amount of scrutiny from thousands of users and bloggers. This is a position that requires a thick skin, amazing skills, and supernatural confidence.
      </p>

      <h5>I’m Your Woman</h5>
      <p>
        I didn’t make this page lightly, and have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. I love a challenge. I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. And I look forward to making 37signals better by my addition. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together.

        I always felt Leanna had a knack for coding and was delighted with what she did with no help from me! Perhaps someday we can tap her for her expertise to do our lab site!
