Recently Stack Overflow provided the results of its [2017 developer survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/03/22/now-live-stack-overflow-developer-survey-2017-results/?cb=1). While there is tons of data and lots of interesting things to discuss within it. One figure specifically stuck out to me.

It is amazing that still today about 9 out of 10 developers are male. While they do mention that this percentage is higher that last year, these numbers are embarrassingly low. We need to figure out how to affect change and encourage diversity. I believe there are two major things that need to happen to start this. First we need to acknowledge that there is a problem. Second we need to start having conversations about it. This is starting to happen in Omaha but needs to happen worldwide.

Or maybe women are just smarter and don't need stack overflow?
