title:  "Building a Ruby CLI App"
---

To create a new ruby program and run it in the terminal, you can make a new text file and name it anything with a .rb extension such as hello.rb. By using your favorite text editor, you can write your ruby code such as ```puts "Hello world!```. To execute the file with ruby you can type ```ruby hello.rb``` into the command line.

To make things simpler to not have to type ```ruby``` and ```.rb``` into the command line, we can set the ruby script as executable with the following steps:

1. Include on the top of the ruby text file ```#!/usr/bin/env ruby```. This tells the computer that ruby will be used to execute the program. Therefore, to execute the CLI App, someone no longer needs to type ```ruby``` before the file name. Additionally, the file can be renamed to not include the .rb extension. Now, only the file name must be typed and a ```.rb``` extension is not necessary.
2. To make the ruby file executable, the permissions must be changed. By typing ```chmod 755 filename``` we are changing the permisions to allow anyone to execute the file.


### Connecting that program to a universal CLI command

Sometimes, it may be convenient to be able to execute a ruby app from any location from the command line in the terminal. In order to do this, we must add the file location to /usr/local/bin. We do this by typing ```ln -s $PWD/hello /usr/local/bin/``` into the command line.

When executing a command from the terminal, the system looks in a number of locations to find the file. By linking the current location of your ruby file with ```/usr/local/bin/```, the command will always be found despite location.

### Reading from and writing to files in Ruby

Ruby is able to read and write other files. Within your ruby file you must open the file in the appropriate mode and then it is relatively straightforward to read or write to the file.

#### Reading a file in Ruby

Here is an example of reading a file in Ruby:

	```
	open("questions.txt", 'r') do |f|
		f.each_line do |line|
	  		#here do what you want with the line
		end
	end
	```

Reading a file in ruby can be done many ways. Here I show a straightforward example of being able to read a file line by line. We use the open command and specify the name of the file. In this case the file would be located in the same place as the ruby file. Alternatively, you may need to specify the full path to the file being read. We choose the option ```r``` to read the file. Then after the ```do |f|``` we have another line to indicate that we would like to read the file line by line. We are able to grab each line from the file one at a time and go through every line in this loop.

#### Writing a file in Ruby

Here is an example of writing to a file in Ruby:

	```
	open('hello.txt', 'w') do |f|
		f.puts "Hello world!"
	end
	```

Similar to reading a file, we use the command open to open the file, specifying the name of the file to be written to. To write to the file we choose the option ```w``` for write. The following code between ```do``` and ```end``` are included in the file with a couple choices for syntax. Here I am using ```f.puts``` to write into the file. It is also common to replace ```f.puts``` with ``` f <<```.
