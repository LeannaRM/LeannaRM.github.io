	<hr>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">My name is Leanna McDonald. I'm a student at Omaha Code School. I have been coding since 2008, but recently made the switch into web development. My background includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics, a PhD in biophysics and postdoctoral work in biochemistry.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">A switch from physical and biological sciences to web development may seem unusual at first glance, but the industries and the work are remarkably similar. Both industries are constantly changing and have an incredible breadth of knowledge. Good thing I love constantly learning new things! Writing a program and doing an experiment are a very similar process, both include many unexpected results which require the patience to take it all in stride while problem solving.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">Born and raised here in Omaha, I'm excited to be back. From Indiana to North Carolina to Minneapolis, I have always considered Omaha my home.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">If you're interested in discussing my work or have a career opportunity, please contact me.</p>
