	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">My name is Philip Walton. I'm an engineer at Google on the developer relations team and formerly, senior front-end software engineer at Appfolio. I've been working on the web professionally since 2006, and unprofessionally since 1998 when I made my first website.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">This blog is a place where I can explore the ideas I think about outside of work. I tend to prefer writing about larger, more abstract topics, but occassionally I'll bring up a specific technology as well.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">If you're interested in my thoughts on something, let me know, and maybe it'll turn into my next article.</p>
