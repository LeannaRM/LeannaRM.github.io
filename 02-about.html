	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">My name is Leanna McDonald. I will be completing Omaha Code School in April 2017. I have been coding since 2008, but recently made the switch into web development. My background includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics, a PhD in biophysics and postdoctoral work in biochemistry.</p>

	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">The switch from scientific research to web development may seem unusual at first glance, but the industries and the work are remarkably similar. Both are incredibly challenging, constantly changing, and require an extremely wide breadth of knowledge. I love constantly learning new things and conquering new challenges, so web development is a natural fit. Writing/debugging a program and designing/analyzing a scientific experiment are very similar processes. Both include many unexpected results that require the patience to problem solve in order to eventually achieve the desired result.</p>
	<p class="maincontent maincontent_about">Born and raised here in Omaha, I'm excited to be back in my hometown. In my moves to Indiana, then North Carolina and then Minneapolis, I always considered Omaha my home.</p>
